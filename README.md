# web-scraping-challenge

In this challenge, I use my mad Jupyter Notebook skills to scrape data about Mars from numerous websites. I then compiled this data into a MongoDB database and used the database to create a webpage. This webpage is interactive in that there is a button. When the button is pushed, the webpages are scraped from again and the most up-to-date information is loaded to the page.

The data taken from various websites includes photographs, statistics, and news articles.
